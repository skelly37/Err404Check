# Err404Check

## What is Err404Check?
It is a simple Python script that checks if website(s) display(s) Error 404: Not Found

## Usage
Just download and go. 

The script needs *temp.txt* file in its directory. Put the links one per line in it. The script will:
1) check them
2) overwrite *temp.txt* with only valid links
3) display invalid links in the terminal

## Note
Some websites may ban your IP because of lots of request. I strongly recommend using some VPN, even a free one (like Proton), since it is just for a casual test.

Also, you test at your own risk, don't blame me for getting IP banned
